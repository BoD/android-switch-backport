Android Switch Widget Backport
==============================

A backport of the Switch widget (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Switch.html)
that was introduced on Android 4.

This port works on Android 2.1+.

The current version of this library is `1.3.1`.

How to use
----------

### Adding the library to your project

#### Option 1: Android library project (ant / Eclipse)

This is an Android library project, you have to add it as a dependency to your project (please
see http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject
to know how to do that.)

#### Option 2: Maven

The apklib artifact is available at the JRAF.org repository. Declare the repository and the
dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<repository>
    <id>JRAF.org</id>
    <name>JRAF.org Maven Repository</name>
    <url>http://JRAF.org/static/maven/2</url>
    <layout>default</layout>
</repository>

 (...)

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jraf</groupId>
    <artifactId>android-switch-backport-apklib</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.1</version>
    <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

#### Option 3: Gradle

The aar artifact is available at the JRAF.org repository. Declare the repository and the
dependency in your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url "http://JRAF.org/static/maven/2"
    }
}

 (...)

dependencies {
    compile "org.jraf:android-switch-backport:1.3.1"
}
```

### Using the Switch

Once you have done that, have a theme for your application (or Activity), that declares the `switchStyle` item
to be one of the two possible themes: either `Widget.Holo.CompoundButton.Switch` (dark) or `Widget.Holo.Light.CompoundButton.Switch`
(light).

The simplest way to do that is to create a `themes.xml` file in your project's `res/values` folder with this contents:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>

    <style name="Theme" parent="@android:style/Theme">
        <item name="switchStyle">@style/Widget.Holo.CompoundButton.Switch</item>
    </style>

</resources>
```
And use it in your Application or Activity by updating your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
(...)
<application
    android:theme="@style/Theme" 
(...)
```

or
```xml
(...)
<activity
    android:theme="@style/Theme" 
(...)
```

Then in your layout xml files you use the widget like this:
```xml
<org.jraf.android.backport.switchwidget.Switch
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

### Using the SwitchPreference

Add switchPreferenceStyle to your 'themes.xml'

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>

    <style name="Theme" parent="@android:Theme">
        <item name="switchStyle">@style/Widget.Holo.CompoundButton.Switch</item>
        <item name="switchPreferenceStyle">@style/Preference.SwitchPreference</item>
    </style>

</resources>
```

Then in your preference xml file:

```xml
<PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:switchpref="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto" >

    <org.jraf.android.backport.switchwidget.SwitchPreference
        android:key="testKey"
        android:title="SwitchPreference Test"
        switchpref:switchTextOff="@string/off"
        switchpref:switchTextOn="@string/on"
        switchpref:summaryOff="@string/summary_off"
        switchpref:summaryOn="@string/summary_on" />

</PreferenceScreen>
```

### Sample app

A sample app is available in the [sample](sample) folder, and also on the Play Store:

Credits
-------

The code was copied directly from the Android 4.0.3 (API 15) source code, then slightly tweaked by myself (BoD@JRAF.org) to make
it run on 2.1+.  The few modifications I made are documented in the code (look for 'XXX' comments).
The SwitchPreference part was added later by Intrications (intrications.com / github.com/intrications), also by taking code
from Android and tweaking it a bit.  Other people also have contributed tweaks and fixes, please see this page for a detailed
list: https://github.com/BoD/android-switch-backport/graphs/contributors

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are welcome, as long as they are consistent to the original Switch / SwitchPreference of the
Android sdk.

Please do not contribute improvements that are not present in the original sdk classes!  I believe it would be
confusing for this backport to have a feature set different than the original sdk classes.  It would also lead to difficult situations if/when stopping using this backport and using the sdk classes instead (which should happen when dropping support for old platforms).  Thank you very much.
